# Craft-Beer-Portfolio

This is a personal project for my interest in craft beer.

This was supposed to be a progressive web app...but i'll still need to figure that part out... The course I was following to build this PWA was pretty vague on the PWA part, but HTML, CSS and Javascript tutorials were useful.
